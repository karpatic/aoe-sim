# Architecture

Milestone 0 keeps the runtime split into three small stages.

1. The main thread loads JSON artifacts, owns DOM controls, and renders cloned snapshots.
2. The Web Worker owns `SimulationEngine`, `WorldState`, and the deterministic scheduler.
3. The Canvas renderer draws only the `WorldSnapshot` it receives.

The protocol in `src/protocol.ts` is intentionally narrow: `initialize`, `play`, `pause`, `seek`, `step`, `snapshot`, and `diagnostics`. The main thread never receives mutable engine objects.

Simulation time is integer milliseconds. Positions are stored as fixed-point integers at scale 1000 and converted to tile coordinates for snapshots. Scheduled replay events are ordered by `(timeMs, sourceSequence, insertionOrdinal)` so same-time commands replay consistently.

Seeking in Milestone 0 resets the world from the initial scenario and replays commands to the requested time. The worker records a repeat-seek checksum diagnostic so the same target time can be checked for deterministic replay.
